Event Simulation
There are two events simulated in this Repo. 
One is a hunter-prey simulation where the "hunter" has to find the optimal location to hunt the prey. 
The other is a virtual doctorâ€™s office where I attempt to lessen the wait time for critical patients using different algorithms for wait time. 

Not a lot of dependencies, numpy and matplotlib for displaying some data gathered by the simulation. There are also some statistical libraries installed for calculations.
